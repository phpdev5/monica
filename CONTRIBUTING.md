## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Monica. We need people like
you to make Monica the best tool it can be.

### 1. Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question, [make an issue](https://github.com/djaiss/monica/issues/new),
we'll try to answer it as fast as possible.

### 2. Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then
[fork Monica](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### 3. Get the test suite running

Make sure you follow the [readme's instructions](https://github.com/djaiss/monica#setup-the-testing-environment)
on how to setup the test suite.

#### 4. Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/djaiss/monica/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/djaiss/monica/issues/new).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### 5. Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

### 6. What can I contribute to?

Even the simplest change is appreciated. It can be a typo error, translating the
application in a new language, fix a bug. No change is too small.
